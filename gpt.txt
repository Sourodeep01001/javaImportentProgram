Subject: Request for Closure of Bank Account

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to formally request the closure of my bank account with Punjab National Bank (PNB) Nabadwip Branch. I have been an account holder with your esteemed bank for [duration], and unfortunately, I have decided to terminate my banking relationship with PNB due to poor customer service.

Over the past [duration], I have experienced numerous instances of unsatisfactory customer service at your branch. Despite my attempts to address my concerns and seek resolution, the issues have persisted, causing considerable inconvenience and frustration. As a valued customer, I believe it is essential to receive prompt and efficient assistance, which has been lacking in my interactions with the bank staff.

Given the recurring nature of the customer service problems I have encountered, I have decided that it is in my best interest to seek banking services elsewhere. Therefore, I kindly request you to initiate the necessary procedures to close my bank account [Account Number] with immediate effect.

Please ensure that all pending transactions and automatic payments associated with my account are duly terminated. I kindly request you to provide written confirmation of the account closure and a final statement of the account balance, including any applicable charges or fees.

Furthermore, I would appreciate it if you could guide me on the procedures to retrieve any remaining funds in my account, including any necessary paperwork or identification requirements. Please inform me of the date and time when I can visit the branch to complete the account closure process. I kindly request that this be scheduled at the earliest convenience.

I understand that closing my account will involve certain formalities, and I am ready to cooperate fully to ensure a smooth transition. I believe it is essential to share feedback on my experience with PNB Nabadwip Branch's customer service, as it may help in identifying areas for improvement to enhance the overall banking experience for future customers.

I would like to express my gratitude for the services provided by PNB until this point and appreciate your assistance in closing my account promptly. I trust that you will handle this matter with utmost professionalism and efficiency.

Should you require any additional information or documentation, please do not hesitate to contact me via the provided email address or phone number. I look forward to receiving your response and concluding the account closure process in a timely manner.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]

Dear Mr./Ms. [Manager's Name],

I am writing to you today to request the closure of my bank account, which is currently held at your PNB bank branch in Nabadwip. My account number is [Account Number].

I have been a customer of PNB for over [Number] years, and I have been consistently disappointed with the level of customer service I have received. In particular, I have had several instances of long wait times when calling customer service, unhelpful representatives, and unresolved issues.

For example, on [Date], I called customer service to inquire about a fraudulent charge on my account. I was on hold for over 30 minutes before I was able to speak to a representative. The representative was unable to help me with my issue, and I was told that I would need to come into the branch to speak to a manager.

I went into the branch the next day, and I spoke to a manager. The manager was also unable to help me with my issue, and I was told that I would need to wait for a few days for the issue to be resolved.

After waiting for several days, I called customer service again. I was told that the issue had been resolved, but I was still charged for the fraudulent transaction.

I am very disappointed with the level of customer service I have received from PNB. I have tried to resolve this issue on several occasions, but I have been unsuccessful.

As a result, I am requesting that you close my bank account. I would like my remaining balance to be transferred to my new bank account, which is held at [Name of New Bank].

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Signature]
[Your Printed Name]


I hope this helps!
